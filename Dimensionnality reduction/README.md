This project has been led by EPF's students in the master Data Engineering 2021 in the context of the course "Dimensionnality Reduction". The goal of this project was to build different prediction model by modifying and reducing the data used to train the model. 

For each model we compared these 3 parameters :
- Business : Is you're work relevant for a business use ?
- Data : Is the reduction really effective in term of size ?
- Computation : Is the reduction really effective in term of performance ?

Different method used:

- Numerical features
- Reduced numerical features
- Add categorical features
- PCA method
